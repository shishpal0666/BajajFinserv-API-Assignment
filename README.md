# Bajaj Finserv Health - Hiring Challenge Solution

This is just another spring boot application created as part of the Bajaj Finserv Health hiring challenge. The application automates the generation of a webhook, solves the SQL problem, and then submits a solution back to the server, all just triggered when the application is running.

## üìã Features

* **Automatic Execution**: There is no need for any manual API calls even at the initiation of the entire flow; everything is triggered when the application starts.
* **Webhook Generation**: Sends a POST request with the user data to generate a unique webhook URL and an access token.
* **Dynamic Problem Solving**: Define the SQL problem to be solved based on whether the last two digits of the user registration number are even or odd.
* **Secure Submission**: Finally submits the SQL query at the end of the process to the webhook URL using `accessToken` as a JWT for authorization in the request header.

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Java**: Version 17+
* **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application.
* **Maven**: Dependency management and build tool.
* **Spring Web**: Used for `RestTemplate` to make HTTP requests.
* **Lombok**: Reduces boilerplate code for model classes.
